## 🔒 Making It Private

### Option 1: Make the Repository Private (Recommended)

1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/NRDL614/invoice-generator
2. Click **Settings** (top menu)
3. Scroll down to the **Danger Zone**
4. Click **Change repository visibility**
5. Select **Make private**
6. Confirm the action

**Note**: Once private, only you (and collaborators you invite) can see the code and access the GitHub Pages site.

### Option 2: Keep Repository Public, Protect Your Information

The current code already has **blank default fields** for:
- Your business name
- Your address
- Client information
- All personal details

This means:
- ✅ No personal information is visible in the code
- ✅ Anyone can use the tool, but they need to enter their own information
- ✅ Your data is safe - it's only entered when YOU use it

## 🚀 Deployment Options

### GitHub Pages (Free)
1. Go to repository **Settings** > **Pages**
2. Under "Source", select **main** branch
3. Click **Save**
4. Your site will be at: `https://NRDL614.github.io/invoice-generator`

**Privacy Note**: 
- If repository is **public** → anyone can access the page
- If repository is **private** → only you can access the page

### Alternative: Deploy to Vercel (Free + Private Option)
1. Go to https://vercel.com
2. Sign up with GitHub
3. Import your repository
4. Deploy (free)
5. You can set password protection on Vercel Pro plan

### Alternative: Local Use Only

## 🔐 Security Recommendations

1. **Make repo private** if you want to prevent others from copying the exact code
2. **Keep default fields blank** (already done) to protect your info
